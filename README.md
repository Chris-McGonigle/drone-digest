# Drone Digest

Drone Digest is a public chat forum style website aimed at both individuals and commercial enterprises with interests in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones.

The pace of change in the UAV market is extraordinary, with new regulations and equipment entering the market numerous times a year. The UAV market is predicted to be worth $63.6 billion by 2025 [*Source*S](https://www.businessinsider.com/drone-industry-analysis-market-trends-growth-forecasts?r=US&IR=T) and will only get larger given technological advances in the use of drones for agriculture, construction and law enforcement to name but a few.

Until now, current offerings for those interested in having a discussion about UAVs are spread far and wide, but only catering to a small niche of the market, for example particular types of aircraft, or split by commercial and hobbyist lines.

The Drone Digest aims to provide a 'one stop shop' for all of these strands, bringing together experience from across the sector so seasoned and budding UAV pilots alike can share experiences, expertise and keep up to date with the latest changes in this ever evolving and growing sector.
