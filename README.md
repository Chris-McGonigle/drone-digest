The pace of change in the UAV market is extraordinary, with new regulations and equipment entering the market numerous times a year. The UAV market is predicted to be worth $63.6 billion by 2025 [*(Source)*](https://www.businessinsider.com/drone-industry-analysis-market-trends-growth-forecasts?r=US&IR=T) and will only get larger given technological advances in the use of drones for agriculture, construction and law enforcement to name but a few.

Until now, current offerings for those interested in having a discussion about UAVs are spread far and wide, but only catering to a small niche of the market, for example particular types of aircraft, or split by commercial and hobbyist lines.

The Drone Digest aims to provide a 'one stop shop' for all of these strands, bringing together experience from across the sector so seasoned and budding UAV pilots alike can share experiences, expertise and keep up to date with the latest changes in this ever evolving and growing sector.

## Site Design Considerations

From the outset, I wanted to provide a bright enticing colour scheme, with modern fonts to try and convey a sense of excitement, and to show that that the UAV world is modern and fun. Current forums online have a very bland colour scheme, normally just white backgrounds with black text.

It was also important however to ensure that there was enough contrast between colours used for backgrounds and text. 

I decided to go wih a blue/green pallette (Cello, #364958 and Paradiso, #55828B) for backgrounds, which modern colour theory psychology states provides calming attributes. 

A shade of orange was used (International Orange, ##FF5400 for buttons and borders to help make these sections pop out, and highlight that users should direct their gaze to these areas. 

Text color selected was Granny Apple (#C9E4CA), for it's contrast against the darker background, but still in keeping with the overall blue green feel I was trying to achieve. Black was used sparsely where even more legibility was required, for example in form input fields.

Font selection was more diffcult, I was wanted something with a futuristic feel for my headings, to try and envoke how modern, fast paced and ever changing the UAV world is. To this end I chose [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron). 

This would have been too much to use throughout the entire site so to ensure the thread content remained legible I chose [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) for my body text. I feel using the fonts in this way makes a good comprimise between legibility and trying to envoke an emotional response in the user.

### Project Management

The Kanban Boards feature of Github Projects was used as the project management tool during the production of this website. User stories were assigned two labels, one an EPIC label, and the second using the MoSCoW prioritisation technique.

EPICS were defined as User Accounts, Message Boards Overview, and Post Interactions. User Stories were then generated and designated as Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won't Have.

Must Have User stories were prioritised for completion first, and these were all implemented by project end. Once completed tasks were moved to the Done pile. Due to a major bug on deployment, one completed User story was moved back into the To Do catergory. This is explained in full in the [Bugs](#bugs) portion of this file. 

You can view the [Kanban Boards](https://github.com/Chris-McGonigle/drone-digest/projects/1?fullscreen=true) to see the project progress. Unfinished tasks would be aimed to be completed in future iterations.

## Features

### Initial Deployment Features

#### Navigation Bar

The nav bar holds the site logo which hyperlinks back to the homepage from all other site pages. It also holds the site serach bar and the Log in/ Out link.

![Nav Bar](/images/readme-images/images/nav.JPG)

#### Search Bar

The site search bar serach the entire site via either subject, name or description. It will return results on full or part parameters. The search bar utilises the Q queryset object imported from Django models to handle complex queries.

![Search Bar](/images/readme-images/images/search.JPG)


#### Logged In Status

Once logged in, the logged in status offers a greeting to the user to confirm that they are logged in.

![Logged In Status](/images/readme-images/images/log.JPG)

#### Subject Filtering

A User can select a thread subject of their choice from the menu on the left (or through the pop up menu on mobile). A list of relevant threads is then displayed to the user on that subject. The thread counter also updates with the number of threads in that subject. By selecting 'All' the filter is removed and shows all available threads.

![Subject filtering](/images/readme-images/images/filter.JPG)


#### Post Thread Window

The post thread window on the homepage shows the latest threads created in chronilogical order. It provides the thread title, which links to the main details of the thread, the author, the thread subject, and the thread description.

The thread author, when logged in, is also able to edit or delete the thread from this window. Threads not started by the author are not available to them to the Edit and Delete Links are hidden for them.

![Thread Window Logged In](/images/readme-images/images/thread-login.png)

If a user is not logged in, these edit and delete links are removed, but the user can still view the thread details.

![Thread Window Not Logged In](/images/readme-images/images/thread-logout.png)


#### Recent Activity Thread

The recent activity thread lists the most recent comments on thread posts. It is designed to help site engagement by showing a user active conversations. By displaying the time, as well as the room details it shows a user how active the site is. For display purposes only the first 50 characters of the comment is displayed.

This added feature is only avaiable on desktop. The decision was taken due to screen size restrictions and the thought that having this as a pop out window similar to the Browse Subject window would not add much to the mobile experience. This could be achieved in future by hosting activity om its own html page and inserting on the homepage via templating for desktop. It does however appear on larger tablets in landscape mode. 

![Recent Activity Thread](/images/readme-images/images/activity-thread.png)


#### View Thread Window

When a thread is selected on the home page, the thread view window opens. It shows a history of the current thread, with comments under it listed with most recent first, and how long ago they were added. A user can also add a comment using the text box provided.

When logged in, a user has the ability to delete their own comment. A decision was taken not to allow the editing of comments to ensure the continuity of conversation, and to be sure a proper history of the conversation is kept. 

If editing was allowed, a user could come in after the fact and change their comment to something out of context and there is currently no way to show that a coomment has been edited. 

If in future the ability to show a comment was edited, this functionality could be introduced, but at present it was deemed to be better not to have this function.

![Thread Logged On](/images/readme-images/images/view-thread-log-in.JPG)

When a user is not logged in, they are still able to view the thread details, but the option to comment is removed. This allows people to browse the site without the need for log in, for example of someone has asked a question and pops baack to see if they have had any replies, this functionality allows them to do so without logging in.

![Thread Not Logged In](/images/readme-images/images/view-thread-log-out.JPG)


#### Thread Participants

Particpants in a thread, or "droners" are shown in this window. The thread author is shown as the original poster asgain, and as different users add comments, their name is added to the list. This was added to help generate a sense of community, and that people can see prevalent posters, and people who may be able to help. In future these would also be hyperlinks to a users indiviudal profile page.

![Droners](/images/readme-images/images/participants.jpg)


#### Site Footer

The site folder holds social media links and a link to the developers Github, These could be tailored to link to whatever required in a real world situation.

![Site Footer](/images/readme-images/images/footer.JPG)

### Future Features

1. The ability to host images was a feature up until deployment, when a bug negated this ability. This would be added in a future iteration. This issue is detailed in the [bugs](#bugs) section.

2. Single Sign On via social media or Google accounts, and now also Apple ID would be a feature to be included in next deployments.

3. An activty on thread, such as total views and reply count could be added in the next iteration realatively easily. Time on this iteration did not allow for this to be implemented.

4. Password reset functionality would be of benefit in the future.

5. A User profile which would include post history would add to the overall UX of the site. This would be also be a feature I would be very keen to add.

6. A private messaging facility between users would be advantageous. It would help to foster a sense of community in the forum and would help like minded people to further develop friendships. 

7. The ability to see a Users online status could help to further develop these relationships, and would allow users to interact more in real time. Again this is open to abuse and bullying so would have to be monitored very carefully. 

8. A robust reporting mechanism should be in place as well before the private messaging facility would be implemented for general site safety and to limit the chance of personal abuse would be advisable. Along with this, comment reporting would also be added to ensure all conversations ahdere to general rules of civility. 

9. The ability to 'like' comments could be added. This was a deliberate choice to however to not include at this point. Likes can sometimes be detrimental to indiviudal users and there has been countless research into how like counts impact self-esteem, the general consensus being that social comparison has an undeniable impact on it, particularly for young people. This could be added though if enough users requested this feature.

## Testing

A dedicated testing section covering validator and manual testing can be found in the [testing.md](/testing/testing.md) documentation

### Bugs

On final deployment, a day before deadline and prior to my final mentor meeting, a major bug was discovered with my initial choice of text editor [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/).

CKEditor had been chosen as it allowed the embedding of images and video within the message body. This was deemed to be beneficial as the developer would not have to take up Cloudinary storage space hosting these files, and instead users could use sites such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and link from there.

The editor worked perfectly in development. However on deployment, the entire comment window was not rendered, making it in effect useless as a user could not create a new thread. The below errors were recevied in the console:

![CKEditor Error](/images/readme-images/images/capture-error.JPG)

I tried numerous fixes such as adding new script tags as suggested in Stack Overflow, and a complete rebuild following this tutorial by [Selmi Tech](https://youtu.be/Zuatckos9Pg) and this by [Codemy](https://youtu.be/mF5jzSXb1dc), neither of which were successful.

I then tried following again the instructions on the [CKEditor documentation](https://github.com/django-ckeditor/django-ckeditor/), double checking things like the static base path, and that all settings in settings.py were correct, and that urls.py was correctly updated.

Finally I contacted Tutor Support. Unfortunately Tutor Support could not fix this issue either, and it was suggested that there was an issue with CKEditor accessing its static files through Cloudinary. 

To this end I had to quickly rebuild this section of the site using Summernote, but as mentioned previously this meant that my inline image and video hosting capabilities were lost at this time. 

As my project deadline was less than 24 hours away, and I had to fully test the site time ran out to find other ways to reintroduce these features, but it is something I would like to look at again in the future.

## Credits

1. Dummy text for display purposes for the threads was taken from a number of existing forums such as [mavicpilots.com](https://mavicpilots.com/), [inspirepilots.com](https://inspirepilots.com/threads/remote-controller-charging-issues.24678/)

2. I used this [article](https://books.agiliq.com/projects/django-orm-cookbook/en/latest/query_relatedtool.html) on how to use Q for complex queries to power the search functionality on the site.

3. [HTMLCSSColor](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/) and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/?home) was used to help pick colour pallettes.

4. Core functionality of the site was based on the Code Institute walkthrough, I think therefore I blog, and also tutorials by [Codemy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtr025c1kHSPrnP18YPB-NFi) and [Traversy](https://youtu.be/PtQiiknWUcI)

5. Tutorials by [StudyGyann](https://youtu.be/uJp4PaDkux0) and [Pretty Printed](https://youtu.be/VYs-u0g__1A) were used to help in the styling of form fields.

6. I also used tutorials by [Academind](https://youtu.be/t7DrJqcUviA), [Tech With Tim](https://youtu.be/sm1mokevMWk) and [Problem Solving Point](https://youtu.be/QLL4KzFMfVw) to help further my understanding of the framework.
